1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: OOP is when everything is created out of objects and classes. Functional programming has many variables, dependancies and functions and small changes can effect the entire code. 

Researched answer: Computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return is an automaticly generated return. 

Researched answer: Ruby returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Test-driven development: Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It follows a cyclical process of writing a failing test, writing the minimum code to make the test pass, and then refactoring the code.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

3. CRUD: create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations of persistent storage. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports.
